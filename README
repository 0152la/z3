Z3 is a theorem prover from Microsoft Research.
Z3 is licensed under MSR-LA (Microsoft Research License Agreement). 
See http://z3.codeplex.com/license for more information about this license.
Z3 can be built using Visual Studio Command Prompt, Visual Studio and make/gcc.

1) Building Z3 on Windows using Visual Studio Command Prompt

- Open a Visual Studio Command Prompt, then execute one of the following commands to build the desired component.

- For building all components, execute
    msbuild z3-prover.sln /p:configuration=external 
  All components will be located at \external

- For building all components (64-bit), execute
    msbuild z3-prover.sln /p:configuration=external /p:platform=x64
  All components will be located at \x64\external

- For building all components (in debug mode), execute
    msbuild z3-prover.sln 
  All components will be located at \Debug

2) Building Z3 using g++/make
Your machine must also have the following commands to be able to build Z3:
autoconf, sed, awk, dos2unix commands

  autoconf
  ./configure
  make
  sudo make install

It will install z3 executable at /usr/local/bin, libraries at /usr/local/lib, and include files at /usr/local/include.
Use the following commands to install in a different prefix (e.g., /usr).

  autoconf
  ./configure --prefix=/usr
  make
  sudo make install

To uninstall Z3, use

  sudo make uninstall

To install Z3 Python bindings, use

  sudo make install-python

To uninstall Z3 Python bindings, use

  sudo make uninstall-python
  

Remark: the Z3 makefile imports the source file list from Visual Studio project files.
To add new source files to the Z3 core, you must include them at: lib/lib.vcxproj
