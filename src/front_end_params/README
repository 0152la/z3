This directory contains the "remains" of the old parameter setting
infrastructure used by Z3. Old code (mostly `smt::context`) is still
based on the front_end_params structure. However, we removed support
for the old INI file infrastructure.  Instead, we have functions for
setting the fields of front_end_params using parameter sets
(params_ref).  Moreover, many of the parameters in front_end_params
are now "hidden".  That is, they can't be set from the command line or
using the command `set-option`.
